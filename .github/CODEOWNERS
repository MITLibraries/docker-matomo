# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo. Unless a
# later match takes precedence, @cabutlermit will be requested for review when 
# someone opens a pull request.This is commented out in favor of using a team
# as the default (see below). It is left here as a comment to indicate the
# primary expert for this code.
# * @cabutlermit

# Teams can be specified as code owners as well. Teams should be identified in
# the format @org/team-name. Teams must have explicit write access to the 
# repository.
* @mitlibraries/infraeng-terraform-reviewers

# We set the senior engineer in the team as the owner of the CODEOWNERS file as
# a layer of protection for unauthorized changes.
