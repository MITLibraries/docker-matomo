# Matomo UsersFlow Plugin

## Description

Map the paths your users take through your website or app. Uncover friction points to create smoother interactions, improve your user experience, and increase conversions.

Ever felt that despite crafting a seemingly flawless site layout, users are still bypassing that crucial CTA? Nothing is more exasperating than realising a mismatched user path compromises your visitors' experience and conversion rates.

Walk your site in your visitors' shoes with Matomo's User Flows - a dynamic visualisation of traffic patterns. Track every step in their journey to see where they deviate or drop off. Segment your user flows to study how different audiences behave and adjust your design for their needs.

Optimise CTAs, address high-exit pages and tackle any navigational surprises with confidence. Shape your user experience, ensuring every interaction leads to higher conversions.
