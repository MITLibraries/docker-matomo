<p>Improving user experience may be a priority, but without the right data or buy-in, it's easy to second-guess your design changes.</p>

#### Stitch Together the Complete User Journey

<div class="left-div-readme" style="width: 50%;">
<p>Traditional web analytics give you mere glimpses of visitor interactions, like where they click or how long they stay. But this alone won't tell you much of the reasons behind their actions.</p>
<p>Overlay your Session Recordings with your visitors' profiles in Matomo to reveal a holistic view of their entire journey, from the pages they explore to their on-page behaviours. See the big picture and act with absolute confidence.</p>
