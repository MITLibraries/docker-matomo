# Matomo CustomReports Plugin

## Description

Create unique reports that adapt to your unique goals and projects. Choose from over 250 metrics and dimensions and analyse your data for unparalleled visitor insights.

Standard reports like the ones you can see in your Matomo dashboard sometimes aren't enough to understand how people experience your site. If you need to quickly uncover hidden insights and provide actionable recommendations, you need reports customised to your needs.

With the Custom Reports plugin, you can tailor your reports to get the right information anytime. Gain actionable new insights that weren't possible before, and start making faster decisions that make a difference in your business.
