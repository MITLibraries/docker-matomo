# How-to instructions

Detailed how-to instructions for miscellaneous scenarios.

## Setup from Scratch

The container-based Matomo installation requires a walk through of the web UI to complete the initial setup. This should only need to be done once, and any future deploy/update should be treated like a restore or a migration (see those sections below).

1. Deploy the ECR repository (using [mitlib-tf-workloads-ecr](https://github.com/MITLibraries/mitlib-tf-workloads-ecr)).
1. Run `make dist-dev` and `make publish-dev` to create and push this container to the ECR repository.
1. Deploy the ECS/RDS/EFS resources (using [mitlib-tf-workloads-matomo](https://github.com/MITLibraries/mitlib-tf-workloads-matomo)).
1. After the ECS service has stabilized, access the Matomo web UI and walk through the 8-step process (you will need to create a superuser and set a couple of basic values).
1. Log back in to the web UI as the super user, navigate to the Settings/Plugins page and **Activate** the EnvironmentVariables plugin. This will update the remaining settings.
1. In the Settings/Plugins, **deactivate** the UserID plugin (see **Data anonymization**  in the [README.md](../README.md)).

## Troubleshooting

It **is** possible to SSH into the Matomo container while it is running in ECS:  `Ensure you have the latest Session Manager plugin installed if you have errors or no output to the following command`

```bash
aws ecs execute-command --region {name-of-the-region} --cluster {name-of-the-cluster} --task {task number} --command "/bin/bash" --interactive
```

This can be used for quick checks of the `config.ini.php` file to see if actions in the UI made any modifications. This is also required for doing major version upgrades of Matomo (e.g. from 3.x to 4.x).

To retrieve the **task number** value for the command:

* Open the AWS Dev1 console in your browser
* Navigate to ECS (Elastic Container Service)
* Click on `matomo-ecs-dev-cluster` (This is also the cluster name for the above command)
* Click on the `Tasks` tab
* Copy the Task number from the list (there should be only one)

OR

```bash
aws ecs list-clusters | grep matomo
aws ecs list-tasks --cluster matomo-ecs-dev-cluster (or result from previous command)
# The task number is the 32 character hex string at the end of the line
```

## Reset 2-Factor auth

If we ever need to reset the 2FA configuration for a user, this is the command to run on the CLI of the container

```bash
./console twofactorauth:disable-2fa-for-user --login=yourlogin
```
